Michael_o_Mara As nice as that sounds, with the scale of Infinity War being immense, this is Marvel's one opportunity to introduce the Symbiote in Space rather than on Earth, I feel like unless Marvel is going the Secret Wars route (which they may in fact be doing) then this is the golden opportunity for him to get the Black Suit and do Venom some justice in a 2nd/3rd Spider-Man film.

stop_stalking_me Because it's a conspiracy and the patriarchy leaders have to cover it up somehow so they have to throw men under the bus every once in a while.

stop_stalking_me I'm sure Sharon Osbourne would find this funny.

stop_stalking_me I like the ridiculously disproportionate ratio of likes to dislikes.

stop_stalking_me It's probably due to all the internships and other programs aimed at getting more women in STEM fields.

stop_stalking_me playing with my foreskin

stop_stalking_me Thank you for the kind words.

stop_stalking_me This is probably just patriarchy using women as sex objects for the satisfaction of sex-obsessed rapist men.

stop_stalking_me "It probably would have been ""shut up you shallow asshole"""

stop_stalking_me This would be solved if we just solved all women's issues first and get rid of the patriarchy.

caeciliusinhorto Well, we all know that actual lesbians don't exist; they just pretend to get men's attention.

caeciliusinhorto I should be doing it the other way round?

caeciliusinhorto I have some issues with the article (I don't think that the author adequately defends their implicit assumption that the reason people cheat is to do with sex, not for the thrill of breaking the rules of the relationship, and I'm also not sure that 'everyone just be non-mono' is as easy a solution as it is presented as), but it's certainly interesting...
